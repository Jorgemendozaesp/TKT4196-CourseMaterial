|------------|-----------------|-----------------|
|  Tuesday   | 14:15-16:00     | S4       |
|  Wednesday | 08:15-10:00     | KJL1     |
|  Friday    | 12:15-14:00     | KJL1      |

### Compulsory problem tasks

Three exercises must be delivered and accepted in order to be allowed to take the exam. The exercises will be graded and the cumulative grade counts 1/3 to the final character. Solutions will be published and presented during exercise classes.  
The problem tasks will be solved and documented in groups by 3-5 students.

### Exam

The exam time and place will be announce in due time. It will have a duration of 4 hours, and will be provided in both Norwegian and English. The grade counts 2/3 to the final character.
* __Preliminary date:__ 

[] December 2020

### Literature and standards

The lecture comprises a compendium that is distributed electronically alongside the lectures and exercises (via Blackboard). Advice will be given on required and further reading.

As part of the course, we will use practical applications and examples to illustrate the theory. In order to solve these exercises, we will use Python as the main programming tool. Please, visit the section [Getting started with Python](py_guide) before the first practical class, which is planned to take place August, 25 and make sure that you have installed all the software that we will be using.

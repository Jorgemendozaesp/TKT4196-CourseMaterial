# NEWS
## Week 38

The plan for this week is to get hands on with the MCS practical. It is possible to ask questions about the compulsory execise, but these questions should be gathered prior to the class. The time of the practical class should be used to work on the MCS practical P2. On Friday, we begin with a new chapter on First Order Reliability Methods (FORM). FORM is a method used to estimate probability of failures in a fast and accurate manner, based on a linear approximation.

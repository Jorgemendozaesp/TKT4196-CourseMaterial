As part of the course, we will use practical applications and examples to illustrate the theory. In order to solve these exercises, we will use Python as the main programming tool. Please, visit the section [Getting started with Python](py_guide) before the first practical class, which is planned to take place this Tuesday 25.08, and make sure that you have installed all the listed software. The first practical class is a tutorial about different aspects of Python that we will be using during the course. The practical uses a Jupyter notebook, which you can download from [Blackboard](https://ntnu.blackboard.com/webapps/blackboard/execute/content/file?cmd=view&mode=designer&content_id=_1083991_1&course_id=_24014_1&framesetWrapped=true).

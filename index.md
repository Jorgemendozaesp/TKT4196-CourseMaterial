## Week 36
NOTE: The solution to P1.1. contained a mistake, which is now solved in the last version of the compendium in Blackboard. You are very welcome to inform us about typos or mistakes that you find in the compendium. 

The plan for this week is the following:

|Ch2 (1.-5.)| T	  | Structural reliability methods: Monte Carlo simulation    |   K	     | on. 02.09   |	KJL1    |

For the first compulsory exercise, you need to organize yourselves into groups of 3 to 5 people. If you need assistance finding a group let us know! We will make sure that every body is part of a group. Groups do not necessarily need to be kept fixed throughout the whole course. Please bring your laptops to the practical classes and check that you have the correct Python and Spyder versions installed. Visit the section [Getting started with Python](py_guide) if you have not done so.
